I choose to use the ROUGE score evaluation method for subsequent problems because it provides a comprehensive assessment of both content overlap and sequence matching, and it's a well-established metric in text generation tasks.


Subjective Evaluation Criterion:
I choose "Logical Consistency" as the subjective criterion (scale 1-5):
1: Completely illogical given the premise and counterfactual
2: Mostly illogical but has some connection
3: Partially logical but with some inconsistencies
4: Mostly logical with minor inconsistencies
5: Completely logical and consistent with the premise and counterfactual
