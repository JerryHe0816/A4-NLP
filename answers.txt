Problem 1 Solutions:

Two objective evaluation methods:

1. ROUGE Score Evaluation method - This method compares the generated text with the reference (edited ending) using ROUGE metrics which measure overlap in unigrams, bigrams, and longest common subsequences, providing a comprehensive assessment of both content and sequence matching.

2. Semantic Consistency Score method - This method evaluates how well the generated ending maintains key terms from both the premise and counterfactual by calculating a weighted word overlap score between the generated text and the input context.


Subjective Evaluation Criterion:
I choose "Logical Consistency" as the subjective criterion (scale 1-5):
1: Completely illogical given the premise and counterfactual
2: Mostly illogical but has some connection
3: Partially logical but with some inconsistencies
4: Mostly logical with minor inconsistencies
5: Completely logical and consistent with the premise and counterfactual
